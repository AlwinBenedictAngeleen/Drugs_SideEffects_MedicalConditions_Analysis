Drugs, Side Effects and Medical Conditions Analysis

Project Overview:
This project analyzes data about drugs, their side effects, and the medical conditions they treat. It helps understand which conditions are most commonly treated and what side effects patients experience most often.

How to Run This Project:

First, install the required libraries:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

Download the dataset from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amaanansari09/drugs-side-effects-and-medical-condition

Create a folder named 'data' in your project directory

Place the downloaded CSV file in the 'data' folder

Run the analysis by typing:
python main.py

What the Project Does:

This project analyzes five main areas:

Medical Conditions - Shows which health conditions have the most available treatments

Side Effects - Identifies the most common side effects reported by patients

Prescription Types - Shows how many drugs need prescriptions vs over-the-counter

Pregnancy Safety - Analyzes how safe drugs are during pregnancy

Drug Ratings - Looks at how users rate different medications

Results You Will Get:

After running the code, you will get:

Image Files:

top_medical_conditions.png

top_side_effects.png

rx_otc_distribution.png

pregnancy_categories.png

rating_analysis.png

Data Files:

medical_condition_counts.csv

side_effect_counts.csv

rx_otc_counts.csv

All files will be saved in a 'results' folder that is created automatically.

What You'll Learn:

The analysis will show you:

The most common medical conditions (like Pain, Colds & Flu, Acne)

The most frequent side effects (like hives, breathing problems)

That most drugs (80%) require a prescription

That many drugs don't have pregnancy safety information

That most drugs get positive ratings from users

Important Notes:

You must download the dataset from Kaggle first

The CSV file must be in the 'data' folder

The analysis takes about 1-2 minutes to complete

All results are saved automatically

Skills This Project Shows:

This project demonstrates your ability to:

Clean and prepare data for analysis

Perform exploratory data analysis

Create useful visualizations

Work with healthcare data

Use Python for data science projects

The analysis provides valuable information about drug safety and effectiveness that could help doctors and patients make better decisions.
